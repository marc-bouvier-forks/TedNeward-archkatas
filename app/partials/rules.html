	<h1>Rules</h1>

	<p>The rules are broken down by the different Phases of the exercise. However, one rule
	trumps all the others: <strong>Any other questions that are not already covered by these
	rules, you may ask the Moderator about.</strong> When in doubt, ask.</p>

	<div>
	  <h2 id="preparation-phase">Preparation: Getting your project team together</h2>
	  <div>
	    <p>The first step is to assemble your project team. There are only a few rules
	    regarding the composition of your team:</p>
	    <p>
	      <ul>
		<li><p><strong>Co-workers may not be in a group together.</strong> Obviously
		in some cases (such as when this is being done internally within a
		company) this will be impossible; in that case, seek to avoid teaming up
		with people with whom you work regularly.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Make sure you're sitting a little distance from any other
		project team.</strong> You'll want to make sure you can converse with
		your team without a lot of competition noise from other teams.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>None of you will really need a laptop.</strong> The point of
		this exercise is not to spend the entire time looking stuff up on StackOverflow
		or on Google/Bing/Yahoo. At the worst, you'll want a silicon-based device
		to access this site, and to maybe help organize your thoughts.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Procure supplies.</strong> However, having notepads,
		whiteboards (if they are available in the room), and/or flip-charts to
		scribble on and debate over are very helpful, and it might not hurt to
		score a few before the other project teams take them all.</p></li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>Once that's done, <a target="_blank" href="#/kata">select your kata</a>
	    and proceed on to the <a href="#discussion-phase">Discussion Phase</a>.</p>
	  </div>

	  <hr />

	  <h2 id="discussion-phase">Discussion Phase: Figuring out what you're building and building it</h2>
	  <div>
	    <p>For the next "N" minutes or hours (depending on what the Moderator tells you),
	    your project team will now examine the requirements for the kata as given, and
	    work out a rough vision of what the project's architecture will look like.</p>
	    <p>
	      <ul>
		<li><p><strong>You may ask the Moderator any questions you have about the
		project.</strong> The Moderator is your customer, your boss, your
		project manager, your IT ops guy.... Basically, the Moderator is everybody
		except you.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Any technology is fair game.</strong> Customers really don't
		care, most of the time, what kind of technology you use... until they
		care, anyway. Just because this exercise is being done at a particular
		conference or user group doesn't imply the Moderator requires you to
		use that technology; if something else makes more sense, run with it!
		Just be prepared to defend its use during the
		<a href='#peer-review-phase'>Peer Review Phase</a>.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>You may safely make assumptions about technologies you don't
		know well.</strong> However, any assumptions you make under this rule
		<strong>must</strong> be clearly defined and described during the
		<a href='#peer-review-phase'>Peer Review Phase</a>.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>You may not assume you have hiring/firing authority over the
		development team.</strong> No assumptions of developer All-Stars; assume
		that a development team roughly as skilled as the one you work with on
		a daily basis will be doing the implementation. (I know, for some of you
		this will be a horrible disappointment. Life is not fair.)</p></li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>The Moderator will give you some kind of audio and visual cue when your time
	    is getting low, and then at some point, time will run out and it will be time to
	    move on to the <a href='#peer-review-phase'>Peer Review Phase</a>.</p>
	  </div>

	  <hr/>

	  <h2 id="peer-review-phase">Peer Review Phase: Presenting your architecture to the rest of the group</h2>
	  <div>
	    <p>During this phase, your project team will be doing one of two things, either
	    presenting to the rest of the group, or listening to other groups' presentations.</p>
	    <p>If you are presenting, you must...
	      <ul>
		<li><p><strong>... present a vision of your proposal to the rest of the group.</strong>
		If you have not yet selected a speaker (or speakers) for the project team,
		now's probably a good time to do so. Remember that "brevity is the soul
		of wit", and keep the presentation to a speedy minimum. The Moderator can
		describe the requirements of the project to the rest of the group if
		necessary, and will speak with the customers' voice during your presentation
		if required.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>... answer questions from the others about your proposal.</strong>
		Remember, these are questions about the project, not about you or your
		overall technical skills. As difficult as it can be sometimes, try to
		remember that these are not personal assaults on your character or your
		professional integrity, but attempts to find the holes in your thinking
		that you'd rather be found <em>before</em> the project ships.</p></li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>If you are listening to the other groups, then your job is to ask questions of the
	    project team currently presenting. Please try to keep the questions constructive,
	    but feel free to openly question any choice or decision that you think might not
	    have been carefully examined or thought out. If the conversation devolves into a
	    shouted "Yes it does!"/"No it doesn't!" kind of back-and-forth, the Moderator
	    may send you both to your room without dessert. Remember that project teams may
	    assume anything about a technology they don't know well, so long as that assumption
	    is clearly spelled out; if they assumed something that you know to be false, by
	    all means inform them of that, but bear in mind that someone else in the room may
	    have different experience with it than you, and keep an open mind.</p>
	  </div>

	  <hr />

	  <h2 id="voting-phase">Voting Phase: Final feedback on the proposal</h2>
	  <div>
	    <p>After each project team has finished their presentation, then we move to the
	    voting phase. The Moderator will call out a "1-2-3", and you will each individually
	    give the project team an overall feedback vote:</p>
	    <p>
	      <ul>
		<li><p><strong>Thumbs up</strong>: You thought they nailed it. They had
		answers for all of the obvious questions, they had chosen tech that at
		least seems credible and feasible, and they have a basic vision of the
		project that doesn't have many (or any) murky areas. This doesn't mean
		they have every answer, or that they have already produced a UML diagram,
		it means that you have every confidence they could produce them given
		enough time.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Thumbs "meh" (out to the side)</strong>: You thought they
		missed a few things, enough to make you a bit uncomfortable that they
		really have a clear vision of what they're trying to build. They forgot
		some key questions to ask the customer, they forgot some important aspect
		of the project, or they just in general didn't give you the feeling that
		they really "got it".</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Thumbs down</strong>: You thought they missed it, badly.
		They made major assumptions that you think had no validity to it. They
		never asked the customer any questions and got burned on a few bad
		assumptions as a result. They thought that using assembly language to
		build a website was a good idea. They really
		bungled the job, and you would never want to work on this project.</p></li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>But all is not finished! Once the voting is complete, the ancient Klingon
	    proverb must be heeded: "Revenge is a dish best served cold". The project team
	    departing the stage chooses the next project team, and we repeat again by
	    going back to the <a href="#peer-review-phase">Peer Review Phase</a> for a new
	    project team.</p>
